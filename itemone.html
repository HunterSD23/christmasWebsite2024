            <h2 class="item-name">Gameboy Advance SP</h2>

            <p>Price: $50 - $100</p>
            <p>The Gameboy Advance SP was released by Nintendo in 2003. This hand-held console served as a foldable upgrade to its predecessor. It comes in many colors, and I honestly like the blue one! It has a nice look to it!</p>
            <p>The reason I want this console is because I have several Gameboy game cartridges I would like to play, but currently do not have a console to play them on.</p>
            <p>I would link a direct page, but you can only buy them from ebay along with a few other sites. Here's the link to <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1311&_nkw=gameboy+advance+sp&_sacat=0" target="_blank">the many listings</a> instead</p>
